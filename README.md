The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive 
comparative analysis of several Software-Defined Networking (SDN) 
controllers (POX, Ryu, HPE-VAN, OpenDaylight, and ONOS). This study 
focuses on evaluating these controllers based on key Quality of Service 
(QoS) parameters, specifically bandwidth and throughput, latency, jitter, and 
packet loss. The experiments will be conducted within a fat tree topology to 
assess how effectively each controller manages network performance under 
varying conditions.
